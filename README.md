## Ebook Rename

For this project I had a long standing list of ebooks with irregular naming as
well as missing version, volumes, or editions. This setup has some manual parts
as expected since we are confirming or evaluating the name the file was saved
with. There could be some automation determined through pdfinfo however, again
I was looking to standardize on naming not use external or manufacturer naming
schemes as they would vary between publishers.

## DVD rename

For this project I was converting some DVDs from physical form to digital to
store on Plex. The television was recently mounted on the wall and having to
store physical DVDs did not fit into the aesthetic. The Plex server could be
stored anywhere with a network connection and power so there wasn't a need to be
physically located near the television.

The ripping applications had their own prefixes that they added to the tracks
which did not match the seasons but instead matched the disc that they were on.
This required renaming the files to match their episode so that the IMDB library
could detect the series, season, and episode and use existing metadata to provide
Plex menu and formatting items.

In addition to the rename I setup a twilio account to send me a text message when
the discs had finished ripping.  This saved me time checking in on the progress.
